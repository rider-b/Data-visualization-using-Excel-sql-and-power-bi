Project: Sales Analysis Dashboard using Excel, SQL, and Power BI
This project demonstrates a full data analysis workflow, from raw data to an interactive dashboard. It analyzes sales data for a fictional company, "Global Tech Retail," to identify key performance indicators and trends.

Project Workflow
The analysis is broken down into three main phases, each utilizing a specific tool:

1. Data Preparation (Microsoft Excel)

The raw sales data was first created and structured in a CSV file.

A new column, TotalSale, was calculated by multiplying UnitPrice and Quantity.

A preliminary analysis was done using a PivotTable to get a quick overview of sales by category.

2. Data Aggregation (SQL)

The cleaned CSV was imported into an SQLite database for more robust querying.

SQL queries were written to aggregate the data, calculating metrics such as:

Total revenue per product category and store location.

Total units sold for each product.

Monthly sales trends over the year.

3. Data Visualization (Microsoft Power BI)

Power BI was connected directly to the SQLite database to import the sales data.

The aggregated data and underlying tables were used to build an interactive dashboard featuring:

A bar chart showing revenue by product category.

A map visual highlighting sales performance by store location.

Key performance indicator (KPI) cards for total revenue and units sold.

A line chart displaying the monthly sales trend.

A slicer to filter the entire dashboard by product category or date.

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: For data creation and initial preparation.

SQLite: A lightweight, serverless database for storing and querying the data.

Microsoft Power BI: For creating the final interactive dashboard and visualizations.

This project showcases the ability to process, analyze, and visualize data using a combination of standard industry tools to derive actionable insights.
